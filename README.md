# NovaFolio

**NovaFolio** is a multi-tenant skeleton for managing **folders/cases/documents** with **fast search** (prefix/partial like “fu…”) and a foundation prepared for **AI (RAG)** and **ICS events**.

> **Goal**: make it work for any business (legal, healthcare, services) and, later, enable “open and highlight” of the exact passage using on-prem or managed AI.
