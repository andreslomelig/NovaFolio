# NovaFolio ‚Äî Intelligent Client & Document Management System

> **Full-stack project** designed to demonstrate applied engineering and AI capabilities.  
> Built with modern TypeScript tooling, a scalable monorepo architecture, and focus on real-world performance and maintainability.

## Overview

NovaFolio is a **smart client and document management system** that allows professionals (e.g., lawyers, consultants, or agencies) to store, search, and organize their client ‚Äúfolders‚Äù (`carpetas`) with powerful indexing, status tracking, and AI-assisted document retrieval.

It combines a clean API, modern developer experience, and scalable architecture ‚Äî serving both as a **production-grade prototype** and a **portfolio showcase** of back-end, front-end, and AI integration skills.

## Architecture

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **API (`apps/api`)** | Node.js + TypeScript service built with ESM and `tsx` runtime. Provides folder/document management, search endpoints, and authentication. |
| **Web (`apps/web`)** | React (planned) front-end using Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui for fast iteration and clean design. |
| **Shared (`packages/*`)** | Type-safe domain logic shared between API and Web layers (types, utilities, validation). |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (migrations, type-safe queries, seed data). |
| **AI Integration** | Planned embedding-based search and summarization (OpenAI / local LLM). |

## Features

‚úÖ Multi-client document storage (upload + metadata)  
‚úÖ Folder (‚Äúcarpeta‚Äù) grouping with tags and status tracking  
‚úÖ Global search and filters (client name, document type, status)  
‚úÖ REST API with input validation (Zod)  
‚úÖ Type-safe monorepo via Nx + TypeScript project references  
‚úÖ Hot reload via `tsx watch`  
Upcoming: AI-powered semantic search and automatic folder summaries

## Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root folder:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/novafolio"
PORT=3000
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the API runs on **http://localhost:3000**

## Example API Routes

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/folders` | List all folders |
| `POST` | `/api/folders` | Create new folder |
| `GET` | `/api/folders/:id` | Retrieve a folder and its documents |
| `POST` | `/api/folders/:id/upload` | Upload document to a folder |
